develop a small system using __MAVEN__ and __Java__ programming language. The system should be able to:
1. Identify zhamri's GitHub followers. 

2. Analyze each of the followers using thread with the following statistics:
   * The number of repositories
   * The number of followers
   * (add your statistics 1)  
   * (add your statistics 2) 

3. The number of threads is based on the number of zhamri's Github followers

4. Reporting format:
```
| No. | login id | Number of repositories | Number of followers | xxxxxxxxx | xxxxxxxxxx |
|-----|----------|------------------------|---------------------|-----------|------------|
| 1   | wzul     | 29                     | 31                  |    xx     |     xx     |
| 2   | Aman748  | 17                     | 14                  |    xx     |     xx     |
```
